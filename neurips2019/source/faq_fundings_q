<span style='color:#c8243e;'>Be advised that we do not guarantee that all the people who submit a proposal will receive funding as we have limited funds. We also do not guarantee we will reimburse the full amount asked for in the application. In addition, reimbursements will only be processed once the final camera-ready version of the accepted submission has been received and that we confirmed you were present at the workshop. Also, keep in mind that you must be reasonable in your expenses (e.g. no first class for the flight, no 5 star hotel). Only the following items are eligible for reimbursement: registration ticket at the conference, travel, hotel/accommodations and meals. Only economy class is eligible. We will not reimburse more than 2 days for hotel/accommodations and meals, and it should correspond to the date of the workshop.
