title: Invited talk - Untangling AI Ethics: Working Toward a Root Issue
abstract: Given myriad issues in AI ethics as well as many competing frameworks/declarations, it may be useful to step back to see if we can find a root or common issue, which may help to suggest a broad solution to the complex problem.  This involves returning to first principles: what is the nature of AI?  I will suggest that AI is the power of increasing omniscience, which is not only generally disruptive to society but also a threat to our autonomy.  A broad solution, then, is to aim at restoring that autonomy.
