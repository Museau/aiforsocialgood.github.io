title: Invited Talk Track 2 - Beyond Principles and Policy Proposals: A framework for the agile governance of AI
abstract: The mismatch between the speed at which innovative technologies are deployed and the slow traditional implementation of ethical/lethal oversight, requires creative, agile, multi-stakeholder, and cooperative approaches to governance. Agile governance must go beyond hard law and regulations to accommodate soft law, corporate self-governance, and technological solutions to challenges.  This presentation will summarize the concepts, insights, and creative approaches to AI oversight that have led to the 1st International Congress for the Governance of AI, which will convey in Prague on April 16-18, 2020.
