Esther Rolf is a 4th year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at the University of California, Berkeley, advised by Benjamin Recht and Michael I. Jordan. She is an NSF Graduate Research Fellow and is a fellow in the Global Policy Lab in the Goldman School of Public Policy at UC Berkeley.  Estherâ€™s research targets machine learning algorithms that interact with society. Her current focus lies in two main domains: the field of algorithmic fairness, which aims to design and audit black-box decision algorithms to ensure equity and benefit for all individuals, and in machine learning for environmental monitoring, where abundant sources of temporally recurrent data provide an exciting opportunity to make inferences and predictions about our planet.
