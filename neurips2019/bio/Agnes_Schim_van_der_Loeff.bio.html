Hi, my name is Agnes and I do ethics and policy research at Cervest, which is developing Earth Science AI to quantify climate uncertainty and inform decisions on more sustainable land use. As part of Cervest’s research residency programme earlier this year I started exploring the ethical implications of such use of AI, which resulted in this NeurIPS paper! Now I am developing a framework to ensure all steps in the development, distribution and use of Cervest’s AI-driven platform are ethical and prevent any harmful outcomes. I hold a first class Honours degree in Arabic and Development Studies from SOAS University of London. Having studied the intersection of social, economic and political aspects of development, I am interested in how dilemmas around AI reflect wider debates on power relations in society and I want to explore how AI could be a vehicle for transformative social change. I am particularly passionate about climate justice, which I have engaged with academically and through campaigning.
