Michael Running Wolf was raised in a rural village in Montana with intermittent water and electricity; naturally he now has a Masters of Science in Computer Science. He has professional experience with IBM, AT&T Wireless and Lawrence Livermore National Lab in Database Theory and distributed cloud computing. He recently gave up a stable career as a Full Stack Web-Developer to focus upon his true passion: endangered indigenous language revitalization using Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) technology. He was raised with a grandmother who only spoke his tribal language, Cheyenne, which like many other indigenous languages is near extinction. By leveraging his advanced degree and technical skills Michael hopes to strengthen the ecology of thought represented by indigenous languages through Virtual and Augmented Reality.
