Thomas Krendl Gilbert is an interdisciplinary Ph.D. candidate in Machine Ethics and Epistemology at UC Berkeley. With prior training in philosophy, sociology, and political theory, Tom researches the various technical and organizational predicaments that emerge when machine learning alters the context of expert decision-making. In particular, he is interested in how different algorithmic learning procedures (e.g. reinforcement learning) reframe classic ethical questions, such as the problem of aggregating human values and interests. In his free time he enjoys sailing and creative writing.
