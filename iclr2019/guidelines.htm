<br>


<b>Blind Reviews</b><p>
Authors were asked to take reasonable efforts to hide their identities, including not listing their names or affiliations and omitting acknowledgments. This information will of course be included in the final version. Reviewers should also make all efforts to keep their identity invisible to the authors. ArXiv papers are not considered prior work since they have not been peer reviewed. Therefore, you should review your short papers independently as if the arXiv papers didn't exist. Citations to these papers are not required and failing to cite or beat performance of arXiv papers are not grounds for rejection. An important general guideline is to make every effort to treat papers fairly whether or not they know (or suspect) who wrote them. Reviewers should not search for the authors of a paper, and complain that the paper is not anonymous if they happen to find them.</p>
<br>



<b>Check Your Papers</b>
<p>
As soon as you get your reviewing assignment, please go through all the short papers to make sure that (a) there is no obvious conflict with you (e.g., a short paper authored by your recent collaborator from a different institution) and (b) you feel comfortable to review the short paper assigned. If either of these issues arise, please let us know right away by contacting your the Area Chair using CMT.
</p>
<br>


<b>What to Look For</b><p>
Minor flaws can be corrected and shouldn't be a reason to reject a short paper. 

<br>
Acceptance and rejection decisions should not be determined solely by the method's raw performance. Rather, it is important to weigh both the novelty and potential impact of the work on the society alongside the reported performance. Impact can be on the research community, but also on the specific problem being addressed. 
<br><br>
Each short paper that is accepted should be technically sound and make a contribution to the field.
<br><br>
It is important to note that the potential impact of a proposition is one of the most important criteria. Some problems do not require technical novelty, but instead thoughtful application of existing methods. Papers in that category (i.e. impactful but not necessarily novel) should not be rejected for this reason only.
</p><br>


<b>Be Careful</b><p>
Please think carefully about your reviews. In particular, it's a good idea to avoid ad-hoc policy innovations, which can occur with the best of intentions. Here is an example. Author submits a short paper relying on a dataset that cannot be public. Reviewer takes the position that this means the results cannot be trusted, and rejects on these grounds. The problem with this review is that it's clearly about a matter of policy, rather than about the short paper's content. We don't have a policy about non-public datasets, and it's unfair for reviewers to invent one of their own.
</p>
<br>

<b>When You're Done</b><p>
When you have finished with your review, you should destroy any short paper manuscript and/or supporting material you received. See the Ethics guidelines below.
</p><br>

<b>Writing Technical Reviews</b><p>
Here are some specific issues to keep in mind as you write your reviews:
<ul>
<li>Extremely short reviews are unhelpful to authors, other reviewers, and Area Chairs. If you have agreed to review a short paper, you should take enough time to write a thoughtful and detailed review.</li>
<li>Be specific when you suggest that the writing needs to be improved. If there is a particular section that is unclear, point it out and give suggestions for how it can be clarified.</li>
<li>Don't give away your identity by asking the authors to cite several of your own papers.</li>
<li>Be specific about novelty. Claims in a review that the submitted work "has been done before" MUST be backed up with specific references and an explanation of how closely they are related. At the same time, for a positive review, be sure to summarize what novel aspects are most interesting in the strengths.</li>
<li>Citations to papers that have only been published without review (e.g. ArXiv or Technical reports) are not required. Therefore, missing these citations is not grounds for rejecting a paper.</li>
<li>If you think the short paper is out of scope for the workshop subject areas, clearly explain why in the review. </li>
<li>Avoid referring to the authors by using the phrase "you". These phrases should be replaced by "the authors" or "the short paper." Referring to the authors as "you" can be perceived as being confrontational, even though you do not mean it this way.</li></ul>
</p><br>

<b>Ethics for Reviewing Papers</b><p>

<b><small>1. Protect Ideas</small></b><br>
You have the responsibility to protect the confidentiality of the ideas represented in the short papers you review. Protection of the ideas in the short papers you receive means:
<ul>
<li>You should not show the short paper to anyone else, including colleagues or students, unless you have asked them to write a review, or to help with your review.</li>
<li>You should not show any results or any of the supplementary material to non-reviewers.</li>
<li>You should not use ideas from short papers you review to develop new ones.</li>
<li>After the review process, you should destroy all copies of short papers and erase any implementations you have written to evaluate the ideas in the short papers, as well as any results of those implementations.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b><small>2. Avoid Conflict of Interest</small></b><br>
There should be absolutely no question about the impartiality of any review. Thus, if you are assigned a paper where your review would create a possible conflict of interest, you should return the short paper and not submit a review. Conflicts of interest include (but are not limited to) situations in which:

<ul>
<li>You work at the same institution as one of the authors.</li>
<li>You have been directly involved in the work and will be receiving credit in some way. If you're a member of the author's thesis committee, and the paper is about his or her thesis work, then you were involved.</li>
<li>You suspect that others might see a conflict of interest in your involvement.</li>
<li>You have collaborated with one of the authors in the past three years (more or less). Collaboration is usually defined as having written a paper or grant proposal together, although you should use your judgment.</li>
<li>You were the MS/PhD advisor of one of the authors or the MS/PhD advisee of one of the authors. Most funding agencies and publications typically consider advisees to represent a lifetime conflict of interest. </li>
</ul>

<br>
While the organizers make every effort to avoid such conflicts in the review assignments, they may nonetheless occasionally arise. If you recognize the work or the author and feel it could present a conflict of interest, contact your  Area Chair using CMT as soon as possible so he or she can find someone else to review it.
<br>
<br>
<b><small>3. Be Professional</small></b><br>
Belittling or sarcastic comments have no place in the reviewing process. The most valuable comments in a review are those that help the authors understand the shortcomings of their work and how they might improve it. Write a courteous, informative, incisive, and helpful review that you would be proud to add your name to (were it not anonymous).

<h4>Reviewer FAQs</h4>

<b>Is there a minimum number of papers I should accept or reject?</b>
<p id='1'>
No. Each paper should be evaluated in its own right. If you feel that most of the papers assigned to you have value, you should accept them. It is unlikely that most papers are bad enough to justify rejecting them all. However, if that is the case, provide clear and very specific comments in each review. Do NOT assume that your stack of papers necessarily should have the same acceptance rate as the entire conference ultimately will.
</p>

<b>Can I review a paper I already saw on arXiv and hence know who the authors are?</b><p>
Yes. See next bullet below for guidelines.
</p>


<b>How should I treat papers for which I know the authors?</b><p>
Reviewers should make every effort to treat each paper fairly, whether or not they know who wrote the paper. For example: It is Not OK for a reviewer to read a paper, think "I know who wrote this; it's on arXiv; they're usually quite good" and accept paper based on that reasoning. Conversely, it is also Not OK for a reviewer to read a paper, think "I know who wrote this; it's on arXiv; they're no good" and reject paper based on that reasoning.
</p>


<b>How should I treat arXiv papers?</b><p>
ArXiv papers are not considered prior work since they have not been peer reviewed. Therefore, you should review your AISG workshop short papers independently as if the ArXiv papers didn't exist. Citations to these papers are not required and failing to cite or beat performance of arXiv papers are not grounds for rejection. For example:

<ul>
<li>It is Not OK for a reviewer to suggest rejection for not citing an arXiv paper or not being better than something on arXiv.</li>
<li>It is Not OK to accept a paper solely because it performs better than something on arXiv.</li>
<li>It is Not OK to reject a paper solely because it performs worse than something on arXiv.</li>
<li>It is Not OK to regard arXiv as a standard for the state of the art, because it is not reviewed. This applies *whoever* wrote the arXiv paper.</li>
<li>It is Not OK for a reviewer to reject a paper solely because another paper with a similar idea has already appeared on arXiv. If the reviewer is worried about plagiarism they should bring this up in confidential comments to the AC.</li>
<li>It is OK for a reviewer to suggest an author should acknowledge and be aware of something on arXiv.</li>
<li>It is OK for an author to decline to acknowledge something on arXiv (because it has not been reviewed and so may not be right).</li>
</ul>


<b>Plagiarism</b>: Plagiarism is a regular nuisance in publication. Plagiarism consists of appropriating the words or results of another, without credit. Generally, reviewers can recognize plagiarism when they see it; it is unlikely that a reviewer will be uncertain whether plagiarism has occurred.

<b>Contact information</b><p>
<a href="mailto:aisg2019.iclr.contact@gmail.com">aisg2019.iclr.contact@gmail.com</a></p>
<br>



<b>Role of the Area Chairs</b><p>
The Area Chairs (AC) identify suitable reviewers for each paper, write meta-reviews summarizing discussion at least for short papers with diverging reviews, evaluate the reviews and suggest acceptance/reject decisions for each short paper. ACs are expected to play an active role in ensuring higher quality and more timely reviews.</p>
<br>

<b>Best Practices of Being an Area Chair</b><p>
We want to remind all ACs of some of the basic (and obvious) practices of being an AC.<br>
You have a strong influence on the decision for a short paper. Please, take your job very seriously and be fair.
If you identify any short paper that you believe may be written by a current or former student, post-doc or supervisor, or by a collaborator in the last two years, please notify the Short Papers Track Chairs using CMT immediately so that the short paper can be assigned to another AC.<br>
The Short Papers Track Chairs did not submit any papers, so they are not in direct conflict with any papers and they know all authors of all papers and also all reviewers/ACs. They will NOT be involved with any decisions of short papers from institutions with which they are in conflict. You can send them a question about any short paper and if one of them is conflicted, another one will respond to you without including the conflicted Short Papers Track Chairs.<br>
DO NOT talk to any other AC about short papers assigned to you without prior approval from the PCs as there may be several other ACs conflicted with the short paper.<br>
DO NOT talk to any other AC about your own short paper (the short paper you are an author on) or a short paper you have some conflict with, during this whole process.<br>
Remember, it is not fair to dismiss any review without looking at other reviews and reading the short paper yourself to make an evaluation. Outright rejecting a review is not acceptable without a clearly articulated supporting argument.</p>
<br>

<b>Meta-reviews summarizing the short paper</b><p>
Area Chair meta-reviews are the MOST CRUCIAL aspect of the review process of the ICLR 2019 AISG workshop. This is where the Area Chair justifies his/her recommendation to accept/reject a paper. The Short Papers Track Chairs will read all meta-reviews and we have committed ourselves to ensure that these meta-reviews are representative of a good quality review process. These meta-reviews should highlight why the decision was reached. If all reviewers agree on a paper, this meta-review can be simple, but feel free to encourage authors and provide constructive feedback. If there is even a slight disagreement on the reviews, it is your job to clarify why and how the disagreement was resolved. Overruling all three reviewers to make a decision on a paper is not acceptable. If you strongly feel that the paper deserves that, make sure to discuss it with the Short Papers Track Chairs using CMT. In such cases, (a) you should read the short paper completely, and (b) provide a detailed meta-review. The Short Papers Track Chairs will review and confirm or reverse any such decisions.</p>
<br>

<b>Meta-Review Form </b><p> <ul>
<li><b>Feedback to Authors</b><br>
For short papers with diverging reviews or short papers where you disagree with the reviewers, please summarize the key things you would like the raise. There is no need to summarize the paper or reviews. If you have additional concerns that were not included in the reviews, please be sure and include them as well.
</li>
<li><b>Preliminary Rating </b><br>
Please rate the paper according to the following choices:<br><ul>
<li>Oral: These are short papers whose quality is in the top 10% of the papers at the workshop.</li>
<li>Poster: These are strong short papers, which have more than one weakness. For example, a well-written short paper with solid experiments, but incremental; a short paper on a well-studied problem with solid theory, but weak experiments; or a novel paper with good experiments, but poorly written.</li>
<li>Reject: These are papers that have some promise, but they would be better off by being revised and resubmitted, or have a major flaw. Reject decisions will be reviewed by an Short Papers Track Chairs.
</li></ul>


</li>
</ul>
Please also be on the lookout for one paper to be considered for the best paper award.</p>
