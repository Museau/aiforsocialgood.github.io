title:Towards Responsible AI Organizations
abstract:OpenAI is well known for the development of tooling, research, and policy towards safer intelligent systems. Examples include the OpenAI Charter, a project on Malicious Uses of AI, and the GPT-2 language model publication strategy. More recently, OpenAI reorganized as a 'capped profit' organization to secure funding for the long-term development of responsible AI systems. For this presentation, OpenAI Policy Director Jack Clark will describe OpenAI's theory of change and what other groups can do to increase the chance of AI benefiting all of humanity.
