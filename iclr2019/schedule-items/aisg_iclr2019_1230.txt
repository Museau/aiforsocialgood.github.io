title:Planning in Home Health Care Structures using Reinforcement Learning
abstract:In many countries, hospitalization costs for both patients and governments have known a significant increase. Recent studies linked these costs mainly to people getting chronic diseases, and patients expressing preferences for their comfort. Home Health Care became a potential answer to these issues by providing health care in a friendly environment and reducing costs while respecting crucial constraints. Using Reinforcement Learning, we propose developing a novel framework to solve the patient - caregiver matching leading to real-world social impact by increasing the general well-being of patients and making a big progress towards integrating HHC in health care system.
