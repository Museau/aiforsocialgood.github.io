title:Because We Matter: Engaging with AI Governance
abstract:With AI and ICT, we are breaking down the traditional lines of autonomy that defined nations, corporations, and even families. This has implications for our economy, our democracy, and our individual liberty. Itâ€™s not necessarily a disaster, though it has already caused some significant disruptions. Getting on top of this problem requires better understanding and accepting the mechanistic aspects of ourselves and our society, then working to find new ways to keep ourselves socially and emotionally engaged, politically organized, and economically productive. Until we do so, we run the risk of handing control of ourselves and our nations to other individuals and organizations.
