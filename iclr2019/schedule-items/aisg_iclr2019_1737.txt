title:Customizable Facial Gesture Recognition for Improved Assistive Technology
abstract:Digital devices have become an essential part of modern life. However, it is much more difficult for less able-bodied individuals to interact with them. Assistive technology based on facial gestures could potentially enable people with upper limb motor disability to interact with electronic interfaces effectively and efficiently. Previous studies proposed solution that can classify predefined facial gestures.  
In this study, we build a customizable facial gesture recognition system using the Prototypical Network, an effective solution to the few-shot learning problem. Our second contribution is the insight that since facial gesture recognition is done based on tracked landmarks, a training set can be synthesized using a graphics engine.  We show that our model trained using only synthetic faces can perform reasonably well on realistic faces.
