    <h4>11:45 - 12:15 Because We Matter: Engaging with AI Governance</h4>

   <p>
        With AI and ICT, we are breaking down the traditional lines of autonomy that defined nations, corporations, and even families. This has implications for our economy, our democracy, and our individual liberty. It’s not necessarily a disaster, though it has already caused some significant disruptions. Getting on top of this problem requires better understanding and accepting the mechanistic aspects of ourselves and our society, then working to find new ways to keep ourselves socially and emotionally engaged, politically organized, and economically productive. Until we do so, we run the risk of handing control of ourselves and our nations to other individuals and organizations.

    <h4>12:20 - 12:25 Problem Introduction - Disaster Insurance: New parametric contracts based on satellite images</h4>

   <p>
        In disaster risk management, a parametric insurance is a contract where the buyer enters into a protection that will payout under predefined conditions, comparing the value of a parameter or an index to a trigger. A disaster index estimating damages can be built by comparing satellite images from pre-disaster and post-disaster using Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). Standardization of these financial instruments could guarantee a timely, diligent and transparent process to release needed funds after the catastrophe, particularly critical for developing countries.

    <h4>12:25 - 12:30 Problem Introduction - Decoding Hidden Language for Social Good</h4>

   <p>
        Bad actors on digital platforms find creative ways to evade detection by moderation systems. For example, large groups of users may decide to use euphemisms or “code words” for communities within hate speech, names of drugs for online drug peddling and criminal activities within gangspeak. We propose the use of robust neural language models trained over large corpora to automatically infer unusual parts of text within specific contexts that may indicate the use of euphemisms.

    <h4>12:30 - 12:35 Problem Introduction - Planning in Home Health Care Structures using Reinforcement Learning</h4>

   <p>
        In many countries, hospitalization costs for both patients and governments have known a significant increase. Recent studies linked these costs mainly to people getting chronic diseases, and patients expressing preferences for their comfort. Home Health Care became a potential answer to these issues by providing health care in a friendly environment and reducing costs while respecting crucial constraints. Using Reinforcement Learning, we propose developing a novel framework to solve the patient - caregiver matching leading to real-world social impact by increasing the general well-being of patients and making a big progress towards integrating HHC in health care system.

    <h4>17:20 - 17:30 Visualizing the Consequences of Climate Change Using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks</h4>

   <p>
        There are many problems related to Climate Change in which AI can help. We chose to focus on making it more real, more personal and more visceral for persons by producing both scientifically sound and emotionally compelling visualizations. As a first attempt, we focused on how to generate images of a typical Climate Change extreme event: flooding. Using a person's address, we use CycleGANs to apply a "flooding" transformation to an image of their home, in order to engage them into supporting necessary actions.

    <h4>17:30 - 17:40 Deep Learning to Predict Student Outcomes</h4>

   <p>
        In the world of MOOCs, an automated machine which reliably predicts student outcomes in real-time (or early stages), would be a valuable tool for making smart decisions about when (and with whom) to make live educational interventions as students interact with online coursework, with the aim of increasing engagement, providing motivation, and empowering students to succeed. Thus, in this talk, we first recast the student outcome prediction problem as a sequential event prediction problem, introduce a GritNet architecture, and develop an unsupervised domain adaptation method to transfer a GritNet trained on a past course to a new course without any (students' outcome) label. Our results for real Udacity students' graduation predictions show that the GritNet not only generalizes well from one course to another across different Nanodegree programs, but enhances real-time predictions explicitly in the first few weeks when accurate predictions are most challenging. In contrast to prior works, the GritNet does not need any feature engineering, and it can operate on any student interaction data associated with a timestamp.

   <p>
        This paper provides a taxonomy for the licensing of data in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
