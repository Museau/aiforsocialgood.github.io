Dr Joanna Bryson is a globally-recognised leader in both artificial intelligence itself and AI ethics. With two degrees each in psychology and AI (BA Chicago, MSc & MPhil Edinburgh, PhD MIT) her original focus was the use of artificial intelligence for scientific simulations of natural cognitive systems. During her PhD she first observed the confusion generated by anthropomorphised AI, leading to her first AI ethics publication “Just Another Artifact” in 1998. In 2010 her work in AI ethics was first recognised by a policy body when she was invited to participate in the EPSRC/AHRC Robot Ethics retreat, where she was a key author of the EPSRC/AHRC “Principles of Robotics”, the world’s first national-level AI ethics soft policy. Since then she has continued researching the impact of technology on economies and human cooperation, transparency for AI systems, and participated in numerous policy opportunities for the UK (parliament, royal society, RCUK, FCA), EU/EP/EC, OECD, Red Cross, Chatham House, WEF, as well as national government and NGOs in Switzerland, the US, Canada, and Germany. She came to Bath in 2002 where she founded the Computer Science Department’s Artificial Intelligence research group, and she was made Reader in 2010. Photo credit: OECD/Hervé Cortinat
