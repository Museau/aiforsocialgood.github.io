title:Keynote - AI for Ecology and Conservation
abstract:AI can help solve big data and decision-making problems to understand and protect the environment. Iâ€™ll survey several projects the area and discuss how to approach environmental problems using AI. The Dark Ecology project uses weather radar and machine learning to unravel mysteries of bird migration. A surprising probabilistic inference problem arises when analyzing animal survey data to monitor populations. Novel optimization algorithms can help reason about dams, hydropower, and the ecology of river networks.
