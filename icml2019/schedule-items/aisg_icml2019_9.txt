title: Panel : Bridging Critics and Designers of Socially Impactful AI
abstract:We will explore how AI systems can be designed and evaluated in a ways that include voices beyond tech. How can systems be designed in a participatory way? How can real problems be addressed with AI technology, without lapsing into solutionism? How do best practices in development and governance vary across contexts? We will consider these questions and others, in an effort to better characterize and control the social impacts of AI.
