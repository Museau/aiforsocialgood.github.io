title:Keynote - Solving societal challenges with AI through partnerships
abstract:Wadhwani AI was inaugurated a little more than a year ago with the mission of bringing the power of AI to address societal challenges, especially among underserved communities throughout the world. We aim to address problems all major domains including health, agriculture, education, infrastructure, and financial inclusion. We are currently working on three solutions (two in health and one in agriculture) and are exploring more areas where we can apply AI for social good.The most important lesson that we have learned during our short stint is the importance of working in close partnership with other stakeholders and players in the social sectors, especially NGOs and Government organizations. In this talk, I will use one case, namely that of developing an AI based approach for Integrated Pest Management (IPM) in Cotton Farming, to describe how this partnership based approach has evolved and been critical to our solution development and implementation.
