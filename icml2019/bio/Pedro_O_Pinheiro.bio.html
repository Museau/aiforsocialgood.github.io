Dr. Pinheiro is a research scientist at Element AI, in Montreal, Canada. His research focuses on computer vision, machine learning, and their intersection. He finished his PhD in 2017 at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), in Switzerland, under the supervision of Ronan Collobert (and working closely with Piotr Dollar from FAIR). During his PhD, his work focused mostly on large-scale image segmentation problems using deep learning techniques. Currently, he is interested in learning with less supervision and how to leverage knowledge from one task to another.
