Katie recently completed her B.S./M.S. in computer science from Indiana University with minors in math and statistics, and with research interests in anomaly detection, computer vision, data visualization, and applications of computer vision to health and education, like her senior thesis detecting dyslexia with neural networks. She worked at IBM Research in the summer of 2018 on neuromorphic computing, and will be returning there full-time. She hopes to potentially get a PhD and become a corporate research scientist.
