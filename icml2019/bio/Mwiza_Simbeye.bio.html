Mwiza Simbeye is a tech enthusiast and aficionado who is driven by passion for change. He is a computer science student at the African Leadership University and is currently leading an AI Lab at the university; to foster research and development for AI at the university to solve common problems on the continent under agriculture, healthcare and transport. The topics he binges on are artificial intelligence, the blockchain, cryptography and algorithms. All these fields are tied to something he is passionate about. Regarding artificial intelligence, he has always seen the need to use data and algorithms for social good. He has also had a great deal of experience working with AI through a start-up he co-founded (<a href="http://www.agripredict.com">http://www.agripredict.com</a>). Working with the engineering team to design and build image recognition model architecture for plant disease and pest recognition that is currently used by 27,000 farmers under the SNV Netherlands Development Organisation project in eastern Zambia.  Currently, his work under the Google AI Mentorship Research program is centered around demand forecasting in DC mini grids. He is trying to use the power of crowdsourcing to solve the lack of affordable and clean energy in Africa, while at the same time, creating a sustainable source of Income for low-income earners in rural areas in Africa. In order to achieve this, he believes in the need to decentralize energy generation and distribution via smart metering boxes. But these boxes effectiveness will rely on by the second forecasts to help stabilise the decentralised grid. At the same time making sure we do not give too much or too little to the grid with respect to in-house demand. This also enables people to sell their energy and earn money from owning a solar panel. Under this program, he is mentored by Pablo Castro, a research scientist at Google Brain on how to approach a research problem to actualise a research paper with results that are either experimentally or theoretically correct.
