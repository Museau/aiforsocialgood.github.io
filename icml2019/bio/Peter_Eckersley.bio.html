Peter Eckersley is Director of Research at the <a href="https://partnershiponai.org/">Partnership on AI</a>, a collaboration between the major technology companies, civil society and academia to ensure that AI is designed and used to benefit humanity. He leads PAI's research on machine learning policy and ethics, including projects within PAI itself and projects in collaboration with the Partnership's extensive membership. Peter's AI research interests are broad, including <a href="https://eff.org/ai/metrics">measuring progress in the field</a>, figuring out how to translate ethical and safety concerns <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00064">into mathematical constraints</a>, finding the right <a href="http://www.aies-conference.com/wp-content/papers/main/AIES-19_paper_147.pdf">metaphors and ways of thinking</a> about AI development, and setting sound policies around high-stakes applications such as <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/some-easy-things-we-could-do-make-all-autonomous-cars-safer-faster">self-driving vehicles</a>, <a href="https://www.partnershiponai.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Report-on-Algorithmic-Risk-Assessment-Tools.pdf">recidivism prediction</a>, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/08/darpa-cgc-safety-protocol">cybersecurity</a>, and <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/08/eff-white-paper-how-militaries-should-use-ai">military applications of AI</a>.

Prior to joining PAI, Peter was Chief Computer Scientist for the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>. At EFF he lead a team of technologists that launched numerous computer security and privacy projects including <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/11/certificate-authority-encrypt-entire-web">Let's Encrypt</a> and <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">Certbot</a>, <a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/">Panopticlick</a>, <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a>, the <a href="https://eff.org/observatory">SSL Observatory</a> and <a href="https://www.eff.org/pb">Privacy Badger</a>; they also worked on diverse Internet policy issues including campaigning to preserve <a href="https://openwireless.org/">open wireless networks</a>; fighting to <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/05/apples-crystal-prison-and-future-open-platforms">keep modern computing platforms open</a>; helping to <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/09/open-letter">start</a> the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgh2dFngFsg">campaign</a> against the SOPA/PIPA <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/coica-internet-censorship-and-copyright-bill">Internet blacklist legislation</a>; and running the first controlled tests to confirm that Comcast was <a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/packet-forgery-isps-report-comcast-affair">using forged reset packets to interfere with P2P protocols</a>. 

Peter holds a PhD in computer science and law from the University of Melbourne; his research focused on the practicality and desirability of using alternative compensation systems to legalize P2P file sharing and similar distribution tools while still paying authors and artists for their work. He currently serves on the board of the <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Internet Security Research Group</a> and the Advisory Council of the <a href="https://opentech.fun/">Open Technology Fund</a>; he is an Affiliate of the <a href="https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/">Center for International Security</a> and Cooperation at Stanford University and a Distinguished Technology Fellow at <a href="https://eff.org/">EFF</a>.
