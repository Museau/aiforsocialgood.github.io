    <h4>9:05 - 9:45 Keynote - Solving societal challenges with AI through partnerships</h4>

   <p>
        Wadhwani AI was inaugurated a little more than a year ago with the mission of bringing the power of AI to address societal challenges, especially among underserved communities throughout the world. We aim to address problems all major domains including health, agriculture, education, infrastructure, and financial inclusion. We are currently working on three solutions (two in health and one in agriculture) and are exploring more areas where we can apply AI for social good.The most important lesson that we have learned during our short stint is the importance of working in close partnership with other stakeholders and players in the social sectors, especially NGOs and Government organizations. In this talk, I will use one case, namely that of developing an AI based approach for Integrated Pest Management (IPM) in Cotton Farming, to describe how this partnership based approach has evolved and been critical to our solution development and implementation.

    <h4>9:50 - 10:00 Problem proposal - Detecting Waterborne Debris with Sim2Real and Randomization</h4>

   <p>
        Marine debris pollution is one of the most ubiquitous and pressing environmental issues affecting our oceans today. Clean up efforts such as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch project have been implemented across the planet to combat this problem. However, resources to accomplish this goal are limited, and the afflicted area is vast. To this end, unmanned vehicles that are capable of automatically detecting and removing small-sized debris would be a great complementary approach to existing large-scale garbage collectors. Due to the complexity of fully functioning unmanned vehicles for both detecting and removing debris, in this project, we focus on the detection task as a first step. From the perspective of machine learning, there is an unfortunate lack of sufficient labeled data for training a specialized detector, e.g., a classifier that can distinguish debris from other objects like wild animals. Moreover, pre-trained detectors on other domains would be ineffective while creating such datasets manually would be very costly. Due to the recent progress of training deep models with synthetic data and domain randomization, we propose to train a debris detector based on a mixture of real and synthetic images.

    <h4>11:40 - 11:50 Contributed talk - Using AI for Economic Upliftment of Handicraft Industry</h4>

   <p>
        The handicraft industry is a strong pillar of Indian economy which provides large-scale employment opportunities to artisans in rural and underprivileged communities. However, in this era of globalization, diverse modern designs have rendered traditional designs old and monotonous, causing an alarming decline of handicraft sales. In this talk, we will discuss our approach leveraging techniques like GANs, Color Transfer, Pattern Generation etc. to generate contemporary designs for two popular Indian handicrafts - Ikat and Block Print. The resultant designs are evaluated to be significantly more likeable and marketable than the current designs used by artisans.

    <h4>11:50 - 12:00 Contributed talk - Deep Neural Networks Improve Radiologists' Performance in Breast Cancer Screening</h4>

   <p>
        We present a deep CNN for breast cancer screening exam classification, trained and evaluated on over 200,000 exams (over 1,000,000 images). Our network achieves an AUC of 0.895 in predicting whether there is a cancer in the breast, when tested on the screening population. We attribute the high accuracy of our model to a two-stage training procedure, which allows us to use a very high-capacity patch-level network to learn from pixel-level labels alongside a network learning from macroscopic breast-level labels. To validate our model, we conducted a reader study with 14 readers, each reading 720 screening mammogram exams, and find our model to be as accurate as experienced radiologists when presented with the same data. Finally, we show that a hybrid model, averaging probability of malignancy predicted by a radiologist with a prediction of our neural network, is more accurate than either of the two separately.

   <p>
        The World Health Organization identifies outdoor fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5) as a leading risk factor for premature mortality globally. As such, understanding the global distribution of PM2.5 is an essential precursor towards implementing pollution mitigation strategies and modelling global public health. Here, we present a convolutional neural network based approach for estimating annual average outdoor PM2.5 concentrations using only satellite images. The resulting model achieves comparable performance to current state-of-the-art statistical models.

    <h4>16:20 - 16:30 Contributed talk - Pareto Efficient Fairness for Skewed Subgroup Data</h4>

   <p>
        As awareness of the potential for learned models to amplify existing societal biases increases, the field of ML fairness has developed mitigation techniques. A prevalent method applies constraints, including equality of performance, with respect to subgroups defined over the intersection of sensitive attributes such as race and gender. Enforcing such constraints when the subgroup populations are considerably skewed with respect to a target can lead to unintentional degradation in performance, without benefiting any individual subgroup, counter to the United Nations Sustainable Development goals of reducing inequalities and promoting growth.  In order to avoid such performance degradation while ensuring equitable treatment to all groups, we propose Pareto-Efficient Fairness (PEF), which identifies the operating point on the Pareto curve of subgroup performances closest to the fairness hyperplane. Specifically, PEF finds a Pareto Optimal point which maximizes multiple subgroup accuracy measures. The algorithm scalarizes using the adaptive weighted metric norm by iteratively searching the Pareto region of all models enforcing the fairness constraint. PEF is backed by strong theoretical results on discoverability and provides domain practitioners finer control in navigating both convex and non-convex accuracy-fairness trade-offs. Empirically, we show that PEF increases performance of all subgroups in skewed synthetic data and UCI datasets.

    <h4>16:20 - 16:30 Contributed talk - Crisis Sub-Events on Social Media: A Case Study of Wildfires</h4>

   <p>
        Social media has been extensively used for crisis management. Recent work examines possible sub-events as a major crisis unfolds. In this project, we first propose a framework to identify sub-events from tweets. Then, leveraging 4 California wildfires in 2018-2019 as a case study, we investigate how sub-events cascade based on existing hypotheses drawn from the disaster management literature, and find that most hypotheses are supported on social media, e.g., fire induces smoke, which causes air pollution, which later harms health and eventually affects the healthcare system. In addition, we discuss other unexpected sub-events that emerge from social media.

    <h4>16:40 - 16:50 Contributed talk : Towards Detecting Dyslexia in Children's Handwriting Using Neural Networks</h4>

   <p>
        Dyslexia is a learning disability that hinders a person's ability to read. Dyslexia needs to be caught early, however, teachers are not trained to detect dyslexia and screening tests are used inconsistently. We propose (1) two new data sets of handwriting collected from children with and without dyslexia amounting to close to 500 handwriting samples, and (2) an automated early screening technique to be used in conjunction with current approaches, to accelerate the detection process. Preliminary results suggest our system out-performs teachers.

    <h4>16:50 - 17:50  Panel : Bridging Critics and Designers of Socially Impactful AI</h4>

   <p>
        We will explore how AI systems can be designed and evaluated in a ways that include voices beyond tech. How can systems be designed in a participatory way? How can real problems be addressed with AI technology, without lapsing into solutionism? How do best practices in development and governance vary across contexts? We will consider these questions and others, in an effort to better characterize and control the social impacts of AI.

        Mwiza Simbeye is a tech enthusiast and aficionado who is driven by passion for change. He is a computer science student at the African Leadership University and is currently leading an AI Lab at the university; to foster research and development for AI at the university to solve common problems on the continent under agriculture, healthcare and transport. The topics he binges on are artificial intelligence, the blockchain, cryptography and algorithms. All these fields are tied to something he is passionate about. Regarding artificial intelligence, he has always seen the need to use data and algorithms for social good. He has also had a great deal of experience working with AI through a start-up he co-founded (<a href="http://www.agripredict.com">http://www.agripredict.com</a>). Working with the engineering team to design and build image recognition model architecture for plant disease and pest recognition that is currently used by 27,000 farmers under the SNV Netherlands Development Organisation project in eastern Zambia.  Currently, his work under the Google AI Mentorship Research program is centered around demand forecasting in DC mini grids. He is trying to use the power of crowdsourcing to solve the lack of affordable and clean energy in Africa, while at the same time, creating a sustainable source of Income for low-income earners in rural areas in Africa. In order to achieve this, he believes in the need to decentralize energy generation and distribution via smart metering boxes. But these boxes effectiveness will rely on by the second forecasts to help stabilise the decentralised grid. At the same time making sure we do not give too much or too little to the grid with respect to in-house demand. This also enables people to sell their energy and earn money from owning a solar panel. Under this program, he is mentored by Pablo Castro, a research scientist at Google Brain on how to approach a research problem to actualise a research paper with results that are either experimentally or theoretically correct.
